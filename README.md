CSE-4116 Computer & Network Security Laboratory Codes

This repo contain the implementation of various encryption and decryption cryptographic algorithms and a attack method on those methods. The main purpose of this lab is to understand how those alogrithms work and implement them and observe their ability to protect the data.

In this lab, we need to handle large prime numbers. Since, the usual programming languages do not support a datatype or a direct container to hold or handle large prime numbers, special libraries or modules can be used to handle and manage big prime numbers.

In this lab I have used GMPXX library in C++ to handle and manage big prime numbers.



## What is GMPXX?

The 'gmpxx' library is C++ interface to the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmatic Library (GMP).GMP is a free library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. The gmpxx library provides a more user-friendly and idiomatic C++ interface to GMP's functionality, making it easier to use in C++ programs.

## Why to use GMPXX?

- Arbitrry-Precision Arithmatic
- Performance
- Ease of use
- Rich Set of Functions
## How to install GMPXX on Windows?

[Watch the video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqUCz0Mt0Mo) and follow the instructions.


## Other Ways to Handle Big Prime Numbers

- Boost MultiPrecision Library in C++
- GMP Library in C
- BigInterger Library in Java
- Raw Python
- Karatsuba Algorithm
